They often feature scenes that startle the viewer through the means of macabre and the supernatural, thus they may overlap with the fantasy and supernatural genre. Horrors frequently overlap with the thriller genre. Horror films deal with the viewer's nightmares, hidden worst fears, revulsions and terror of the unknown. Although a good deal of it is about the supernatural, if some films contain a plot about morbidity, serial killers, a disease/virus outbreak and surrealism, they may be termed ""horror"".

Jai has a knack of getting into trouble. His Father was a gangster who wanted to reform. On assurance from his friend Inspector Joseph, Jai's father agreed to rat on his evil bosses. Inspector Joseph guaranteed him that he would find Jai's father and Jai a safe passage into the world of good once his bosses have been exposed. But the unexpected happened. Jai witnessed the fatal double cross on his father, despite his confession, by a senior police officer. Joseph's valiant effort to save him went in vain. This traumatic incident left a lasting impression on Jai's mind that there was no point in being good and that 'It's Good to be Bad.' Joseph adopted Jai out of guilt and tried to instill his Christian values of finding a God within but the memories from the past had already cast themselves deep in Jai's mind. Despite repeated attempts to reform him, Joseph failed to ignite the light of good within Jai's soul. And when matters went almost completely out of hand with Jai's checkered criminal life, Joseph arranged an alternate identity for him as Suraj Bhardwaj and sent him away to Australia - a land far away from his past. Jai had promised Joseph in Australia he would stay clear of any trouble. It was a golden chance to feel the grass on the other side of the fence. Almost immediately after landing Jai met Suhani, an Indian Australian with an unadulterated honest vision of 'one world'. Although she hailed from a conservative traditional Punjabi family that took pride in being Indian, Suhani secretly fostered a much liberal outlook towards life. Her elder brother Samarth was just the opposite. Samarth was convinced that Australians had a one-point agenda to bring Indians down. Jai found his home with the bumbling punju boys GoldE and gang. They were happy go lucky 'sardar' boys who knew that the ticket to heaven was through attaining a permanent residency in Australia. GoldE almost echoed Joseph's voice when he warned Jai to stay out of trouble and concentrate on his work - he arranged for Jai to get a job as a taxi driver in Samarth's garage. Suhani was intrigued by Jai's manner. He was flirting but with a flair. He was lying but in style and he was conniving but with a pure heart. She could spot in the first instant that she met Jai that beyond his prankster, lying front Jai had a deeper side to himself that Jai refused to acknowledge. Jai knew that if he could make Suhani fall in love with him he could eventually attain permanent residency by marrying her but her brother was too much of an obstacle. So while Jai was busy scheming for Suhani's love he was also flirting with Nicole, the stripper from a nearby strip club. But his problems with Nicole were almost similar to Suhani's as Nicole's brother, Russel, was a rowdy skinhead from the block. Jai had sworn to Joseph that he would not get his hands in any racket but trouble followed Jai He found himself at a crossroad where he was left with no other option but to take a fair stand. It was a time when he had to figure whether it's Good to be bad or it is Good to be Good.

Fist Of Fear Touch Of Death	1980	Hindi	" Fist Of Fear Touch Of Death also known as The Dragon and the Cobra. TV reporter Adolph Caesar is outside Madison Square Garden before the start of a martial arts tournament that will apparently determine the ""successor"" to the legacy of Bruce Lee. He interviews martial arts promotor Aaron Banks, who says that Lee was actually killed by a kung fu move called ""The Touch of Death."" From inside Madison Square Garden, Caesar talks about some of the competitors (including Bill Louie, who, while in the ring, pokes an opponents eyes out and flings them into the audience). He talks about the legacy of Bruce Lee, and shows some ""interview"" footage he did with Lee shortly before his death. (The Lee footage is actually scenes of him on the TV show Longstreet with new dialogue awkwardly dubbed in the soundtrack). Then, Caeser flashes back to earlier in the day, when action star Fred Williamson went through a number of wacky obstacles to get to the tournament. Another action star, Ron Van Clief is also profiled and interviewed. Van Clief is then seen saving a woman from being raped. The middle section of the film is devoted to ""The Bruce Lee Story,"" a chronicle of Bruce Lee's early years in China, where he is depicted as being ""karate crazy,"" much to the dismay of his parents (the footage from this section of the story is from the 1957 Bruce Lee film Thunderstorm, and has been redubed). The film purports that he was learning karate to live up to the legacy of his great grandfather, who was ""one of China's greatest Samurai masters"" (China did not actually have Samurai, which were Japanese warriors; in addition, the footage for this sequence is from Invincible Super Chan). Later, Lee leaves home and lands a career as an actor, which leads to a scene of Bill Louie, dressed as Kato from The Green Hornet, saving two female joggers from being raped near the World War II memorial in Battery Park in broad daylight. After Caesar announces the conclusion of ""The Bruce Lee Story,"" we're back in Madison Square Garden, where a number of performers are showcased. Caesar interviews Fred Williamson, who denounces the idea of a contest to determine Bruce Lee's successor.

About the film: Though the film story was credited to Mani Rathnam and Ramgopal Verma, the basic plotline was taken from Mario Puzo's popular novel Godfather. The book already inspired the film Neti Siddhartha (1990) starring Nagarjuna, Krishnam Raju, Ayesha Julka, and Sobhana, under the direction of late Sri Kranthi Kumar. (The film had wonderful music by the duo Lakshmikanth-Pyarelal - Osi manasaa neeku telusaa..., nuvvE kadaa naa sweet-u figure-u..., girilO laahiri, giri kOna pandiri..., etc.) But, Neti Siddhartha faithfully followed the screenplay of Godfather as well as Late Feroz Khan's Hindi film Dharmatma (1975). Gaayam followed the same basic story but a lot of changes were made to suit the nativity.

Garana Donga	1990	Telugu	" Garana Donga directed by debutant Ravi, was aimed to resurrect the career of Prabhu Deva. The movie was lying in the cans for a long time due to financial problems. The film is released now and surprisingly it is a fast paced one with action, sentiments, romance and glamour in the right proportion.Allaudin (Prabhu Deva) is an illiterate who lives in Allikuppam, where he was abandoned as a child. He grows up in the slums and fights against injustice towards the people with whom he shares a special bond. Allaudin's enemy is Gangadhar (Raghuvaran), a ruthless man. One day Allaudin finds evidence that Gangadhar had committed a murder and thus he becomes our hero's Magic Lamp, as he starts blackmailing him. Thus the messiah of poor slum dwellers becomes a sort of Robin Hood by satisfying all the needs of the people dear to him. In the meantime, Allaudin falls in love with Gangadhar's employee's daughter (Aashima). And in a gripping climax, Allaudin is shot, a twist in the climax is revealed then. After a long hibernation a Prabhu Deva film is releasing in Tamil and this long wait seemed to have paid off, as the audience get to see a new improved Deva. He has matured as an actor. Aashima after the cameo appearance in Ramana has a plum role here, but she has nothing much to emote. Raghuvaran is terrific as usual in the role of the villain. Ramnath Shetty's camera, Mani Sharma's music and the song picturisations are worth mentioning. On the whole the film is enjoyable and engaging at times.

Ghatotkach	2009	Hindi	" Ghatothkach was the son of mighty Bhim who grew up in the jungle with his mother. More importantly, he was a magician who could make magic out of nothing. All he used was an abracadabra -like spell to transform his best friend Gajju the elephant into a rat, or himself into a woman. And herein lies the problem of the film, which begins on the right note as a fun-filled caper of naughty Ghattu and dumb Gajju as they romp through the jungle, dive in the deep seas or fly into the horizon, much to the discomfiture of mom Hidimba. But childhood is short-lived and the kid magician grows into a pot-bellied man magician who is determined to help his cousin, Abhimanyu. He airlifts his brother's girlfriend into the jungle and takes her form in the palace, since she is being forced to wed the mean Kaurava's son. Under the benign gaze of Krishna, our hero tries to have a ball, masquerading as a timid girl. Sadly, these parts ain't too funny for kids and tend to get tedious for the accompanying adults too. Nevertheless, all said and done, there's a lot of money and effort that's gone into creating a paean to a lesser known hero who dabbles in special-effects jugglery.

And herein lies the problem of the film, which begins on the right note as a fun-filled caper of naughty Ghattu and dumb Gajju as they romp through the jungle, dive in the deep seas or fly into the horizon, much to the discomfiture of mom Hidimba. But childhood is short-lived and the kid magician grows into a pot-bellied man magician who is determined to help his cousin, Abhimanyu. He airlifts his brother's girlfriend into the jungle and takes her form in the palace, since she is being forced to wed the mean Kaurava's son. Under the benign gaze of Krishna, our hero tries to have a ball, masquerading as a timid girl. Sadly, these parts ain't too funny for kids and tend to get tedious for the accompanying adults too. Nevertheless, all said and done, there's a lot of money and effort that's gone into creating a paean to a lesser known hero who dabbles in special-effects jugglery.

And before Kansa could destroy his sister's eight child born to kill him, he was taken away to Gokhul where he was brought up as the son of Nand and Yashoda. When Kansa came to know that his enemy was growing up in Gokul, he sent one demon after another to kill him. But instead, Putana, Kaliya and all other demons were destroyed by Krishna. Ultimately kansa sent Akrura to bring Gopal Krishna to Mathura-little knowing that he was inviting his own death! To save his life Kansa used every magic that he knew to entice Krishna. But, alas, all his tricks failed and in the battle of wits as well as guts that ensured between them Kansa, the tyrant met his death at the hands of his nephew Lord Krishna.

Holiday	2006	Hindi	" Holiday Synopsis : Director Pooja Bhatt goes on the lighter side this time with Holiday after her heavy Paap. Holiday is the story of an ugly, clumsy, and unpopular girl frustrated by all her failures and just once wants to make her father proud. Her sister plays the role equivalent to the stereotypical American ""blonde ditz,"" and might I add, she did a pretty poor job at it. The girl falls in love at sight with Dino, a salsa dance teacher. She gets herself involved in his personal problems with Kashmira Shah. This story had lots of potential such as developing the sister's relationship with her ""boyfriend,"" but was sadly left alone. Nonetheless, there were a few good scenes. My favorite is the one where Dino tells the girl to not be crushed by others and lose her identity, or she will just become another face in the crowd, the theme of the movie. This scene takes the movie beyond your typical ""ugly duckling"" story and gives it much more depth. The protagonist was poorly casted. She gave a poor performance. Dino's immense efforts in learning salsa and his character clearly showed through the screen. Kashmira was also good "	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxLwIJsoPc4	http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/FxLwIJsoPc4/movieposter.jpg?v=4e4a432d	 Pooja Bhatt 	"Onjolee Nair, Dino Morea, Kashmira Shah"

Resting at the northern tip of Uttar Pradesh, Bijnor is still untouched by the progress which is reserved for the metros; just like so many other small towns of India. A few hours from Delhi, Bijnor is still trying to wrestle out of its poverty and its oblivion. He was not a thief, nor a gun-toting criminal. He was not a warlord either. But the city of Bijnor was well aware of this Bhaisaab (Elder Brother); some revered him, some feared him but none ignored him. Closely guarded by the loyalist, Jaswant Sisodia ruled the city of Bijnor; his business empire comprising of sugarcane mills, country liquor distilleries and various other enterprises; some legal and mostly illegal. With parents dead in his formative years, Jaswant was brought up by his father's man Friday, Rajbir. Rajbir and his fourteen-year old son was the only family known to Jaswant, who was now in the prime of his youth. Rajbir's son was in awe of his mentor; some day he would want to be like Jaswant.

Love In Tokyo	1976	Hindi	" Love in Tokyo was shot on location in Japan shortly after the 1964 Olympics. The story starts off in India where Ashok (Joy Mukherji) is being pressured to marry a woman he doesn't love. His elderly mother asks him to travel to Tokyo to pick up his eight year old nephew, a recently orphaned boy named Chikoo whom Ashok has never met because his family disowned his older brother after he married a Japanese woman. Ashok arrives in Tokyo only to discover that Chikoo has no intention of going to India, a country he has never seen before. Ashok hopes to win his nephew over by taking him on an expensive shopping trip, but the boy escapes when his attention is diverted by a beautiful woman named Asha (Asha Parekh), whom he sees performing a traditional Indian dance on television. Asha was also orphaned as a child and raised by her uncle in the Indian community of Tokyo. Asha's uncle wants her to marry a man she despises, a boorish, chain smoking airline pilot named Pran. Asha runs away after she discovers that the two men have cooked up a fiendish plot to get their hands on her sizable inheritance. Chikoo and Asha both end up in the same hiding place and form an alliance against their uncles. Asha protects the boy by posing as a bearded Sikh until she realizes that she has fallen in love with Ashok. She later pretends to be Chikoo's Japanese aunt in order to win Ashok's heart without being discovered. The movie has subplot involving a friend of Ashok's named Mahesh (popular comedian Mehmood) who comes to Tokyo to marry a woman from a higher class. There's a hilarious scene where Mehmood fools his potential father-in-law by posing as an ""International Geisha"" who just happens to speak Hindi fluently. Love in Tokyo contains the fast paced witty dialogue found in many Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn romantic comedies. It would have made an excellent 90 minute film but the actual length is almost twice that. The second half contains enough melodrama to fill a season of General Hospital and the ending is straight out of a James Bond movie. However it's important to remember that Bollywood is not Hollywood and moviegoers in each country have different expectations. The film contains two of the most beloved songs from Indian cinema: ""Love in Tokyo"" by Rafi Mohamed and ""Sayonara"" by Lata Mangeshkar. The latter is the reason that Japanese tourists in India are often greeted with a cheery ""sayonara sayonara"".

He traces her to Vizag, where he realizes that she is deeply in love with Prem (Arun Kumar), an accomplished cricker, cum industrialist. He is heart-broken, but he decides that true love is all about making the person you love get what she wants, and so stages an elaborate hoax to help Jothi get Prem.Prem is in love with Nandini (Deepu), a TV anchor, and Jothi is depressed by that. Mano introduces himself to her as Nandini's ex who she dumped for Prem, and tells Jothi that if they work together, they can break up Prem and Nandini, and then she can get Prem and he can get Nandini. So they scheme, and film is all about how they first get Prem and Nandini to break up, and how Mano then gets Prem to fall in love with Jothi and gets them married.The film takes the moral high-ground on making Jothi unite with her love, but you are wondering if it isn't wrong to break up two lovers (Prem and Nandini). To give the girl he loves what she desires, Mano has no qualms about destroying the love of two others. It's unlikely the audiences are going to bother with this -- what they will bother about is an overdose of tragedies from Bharat coming their way. After Premiste, it's now Maha.The performances by the lead pair are brilliant -- Bharat portrays a heart-broken lover so authentically, you wonder if he's gone through one. Remember, the 8th guy has also failed in love. Mallika as a bubbly young girl wearing her emotions on her sleeve is quite lovable, and she looks quite good in her teenagers' attire, too. All performances are good.The music by Yuvan Raja has some innovative tracks. The dubbing (this is a Tamil film) is passable, but there is too much Tamil script all over the place -- our neighbours down south are taking Telugu audiences more for granted with each passing film, doing lesser and lesser cleaning up.

The grief-stricken Seenu mopes around, and in a fight sequence, he wins the heart of the flashy, curvy and rose-lipped Vasu (Harish), who introduces him to his family. His sister ties Seenu a rakhi, and his mother feeds him payasam. Vasu shows him his room. And Vasu takes him to a Friendship Day function. And Vasu offers to buy him a bike. And Vasu takes him to Araku Valley. And Vasu can't keep his hands off Seenu. Is this friendship? We hope so! Seenu is smitten by a girl who he keeps seeing on the road and in the temple, but he has no clue of what her name is, where she lives, what she does for a living etc. Vasu knows Seenu is in love with this dame, Sandhya, but befriends her and even helps her out in her search for a subject for an biography she plans to write. The villain plays with Seenu's head by telling him his friend is a traitor. Seenu doesn't believe it at first, but he too sees them 'moving closely', and is furious. First his father, then his mother, and now this. Why does Seenu always end up lonely? How come love evades him? Given the fun that all those couples, who pay to sit in dumps that screen duds like these, are having, Seenu might as well be on the other side of the screen. On second thoughts, in that case, there would have been no dud to screen, and no dumps for couples to sit in and have fun, so Seenu does the mature and sensible thing and gets back to reality, and drives his Sumo - anonymously - over Vasu. Anonymously, because he wears sunglasses while doing it. It turns out that Vasu was trying to make Sandhya fall in love with Seenu, but everyone misunderstood. Seenu, of course, knows nothing of all this, is still seething with rage at Vasu, and tries to court Sandhya, who doesn't know he's her 'subject'. But Vasu is so nice that though he knows Seenu did it, all he's worried about is how he is doing. Is this love? We sure hope not!!! We don't want new and unconventional angles to this concept at this stage! "	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-Ovqfz84t4	http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/o-Ovqfz84t4/movieposter.jpg?v=4f4f3192	 T.

Pak Pak Pakaak	2006	Marathi	" Pak Pak Pakaak is a Marathi movie about a small naughty boy and a supposedly ghost living in a forest. The story is conceptualized by Sai Paranjpe and is very similar to her 2001 movie 'Bhaago Bhoot'. The story is of a parent-less little boy, chiklu who plays pranks on everybody in the village. His old grandmother is also fed up with his activities that she resorts to punish him now and then. The village is surrounded by a big forest which inhabits a ghost named as ?bhootya?. The villagers are afraid to venture into the forest alone in the fear that they will be harmed by bhootya. Bhootya is actually a herbal doctor living in isolation from the society. He has been wronged and his wife killed which makes him loose hope and trust in humanity.Chiklu while playing another prank on his teacher ventures into the jungle to find he facing Bhootya. After some confrontation, Chiklu and Bhootya accept each other. Bhootya teaches Chiklu to be good and Chiklu convinces him to come back to the society which he had shunned long back. Just as Chiklu changes, he understands the changing attitude of others toward him. He understands that earlier people who had cursed him were appreciative of his behaviour.The journey of Chiklu from being a naughty brat to a nice well-mannered boy is what constitutes the rest of the movie.In spite of having a small boy as a central character, it cannot be termed as a children's film. I would call it rather a fun film to be enjoyed by everybody.

Paravasam	2001	Telugu	" here are very few directors who have managed to strike congruence between cinema for the masses and the classes. If K Vishwanath is a doyen for Telugu cinema, K Balachandar holds the forte in Tamil cinema. Remember some of his Telugu movies like Anthuleni Katha and Amma Katha? Well he is back to the big screen after successful television serials, in the Temal - Telugu bilingual Paravasam.The tale revolves around four key characters - Dr. Madhava (Mahdavan), Simi Sheela (Sneha) and Andam (Lawrance). Madhava is a doctor who becomes an overnight star thanks to acting in one film. His tryst with tinsel town makes him a household name and heartthrob of young girls.Madhava webs Simi. They lead a happy married life almost a year until Rekha, a college friend of Madhava visits them. Rekha reveals that she and Madhava had a child out of wedlock. At first, Simi dismisses Rekha as someone trying to create havoc in her celebrity\'s husband\'s life. Hell breaks lose after Maddy accepts the fact. Simi opts for a divorce. Meanwhile, Simi loses her father, her only support, in an accident. She is left with loads of debt to clear. Madhava helps her out of the crisis and protects her from miscreants. They grow to love each other after divorce but are hesitant to reveal themselves. In a turn of events, Simi thinks that Madhava loves Sheela. With no hopes of living with Madhava, she decides to wed the fusion dancer Andam, whom she had known before.Madhava who still loves Simi is shocked by her decision but goes all out to make her happy and arranges for her second marriage. Meanwhile, Simi wants Madhava to wed Sheela. Both the weddings are scheduled at the same venue. Do Maddy and Simi come together in all this confusion?It\'s the director\'s 100th film and marks his return to silver screen after a hiatus of five years. As always, he excels in the deft use of symbolism to convey messages. The meeting between Madhavan and Simran at the isolated railway station first before marriage and again before divorce is a classical example. Lyricist Vaali chips in with a short role trying to cement the straining relationships.Madhavan essays his part with effortless brilliance. He excels as the heartthrob in the first half and as a pining husband in the latter half. It\'s been quite sometime since we have seen Simran as her usual self. This is one more feather to her cap after Vaali, Kalisundam Raa and Nuvvu Vastavani. Choreographer Lawrance comes up with a good performance with his fusion dance. But, the song in climax just gets on to your nerves.AR Rehman\'s music score has some catchy songs. The melodious Chelia Kusalama by SPB and Sadhana sargam is the best of the lot. The sluggish editing is a sore point of an otherwise technically good film. The climax is too lengthy and tests your patience.

Ramayana - The Epic	2010	Hindi	" Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, is a popular deity worshipped in the Hindu religion. Each year, many devout pilgrims trace his journey through India, halting at each of the holy sites along the way. The poem is not seen as just a literary monument, but serves as an integral part of Hinduism, and is held in such reverence that the mere reading or hearing of it, or certain passages of it, is believed by Hindus to free them from sin and bless the reader or listener. According to Hindu (particularly the Vaishnava) tradition, Rama is an incarnation (Avatar) of the God Vishnu. The main purpose of this incarnation is to demonstrate the righteous path (dharma) for all living creatures on earth. Arshia Sattar states that the central theme of the Ramayana, as well as the Mahabharata, is respectively Ram's and Krishna's hidden divinity and its progressive revelation. *source wikipedia "	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQd5GdVHuqY	http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yQd5GdVHuqY/movieposter.jpg?v=acb7ba	 Chetan Desai 	"Manoj Bajpai, Juhi Chawla"

Roop Ki Rani Jungle Ka Raja	2009	Hindi	" Synopsis-This is in the same genre with Indiana Jones but more tongue-in-cheek. There's a scene where Alan and Jesse are captured by cannibals who plan to boil them up for dinner. The big round kettle must be ten feet in diameter. Far bigger than anything ever seen in Europe or America where big iron kettles are made. If you really like this film category, I would say see it and judge for yourself. Just want to add something interesting from the book King Solomon's Mines which I really enjoyed. H Rider Haggard mentions that on Safari in Africa favorite delicacies enjoyed by European hunters are giraffe leg bone marrow, elephant heart, and ostrich liver. Elsewhere I later read that other favorites are cross slices of elephant trunk pan fried with ostrich eggs. Since an elephant once befriended me, eating them seems to me like eating a dog or horse, secondary cannibalism. But thinking about the other food items makes me feel hungry.

He opposes the killings of innocent upright cop Soorya and he investigates that his boss Dharmaraj (Ninasam Ashwath) is the one who is behind the missing teenage girls. Shukra uses his courage for doing well to the society and finish off his boss Dharmaraj gang. Where is the room for the heroine you would ask? Priya Dixit comes after every action scene dance, sing and disappear. Vinodraj has to make serious thinking on selection of good story. He is a very senior actor now and he cannot just go on giving temporary kick to the front benchers. Except stunts and dance he has nothing new to offer. There is no message at all in this film. He should know that film is a mass media and a film maker has to be responsible. Priya Dixit is awful. Leelavathi is boring. Aswath Ninasam from television to film has been a right choice. He has very good career for powerful villain roles in Kannada. The debutant music director Gautham has taken inspiration from Hindi film songs. One song sung by Mysore Gangotri who imitates the voice of Dr.Rajkumar in his singing is a gimmick used in the film. Cinematographer Mallikarjun has struggled very hard because of too many action scenes in the film.

Story of Krishna	2006	Telugu	" Watch the amazing story of lord krishna and his leelas. Krishna is often described and portrayed as an infant or young boy playing a flute as in the Bhagavata Purana, or as a youthful prince giving direction and guidance as in the Bhagavad Gita. The stories of Krishna appear across a broad spectrum of Hindu philosophical and theological traditions. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero and the Supreme Being. The principal scriptures discussing Krishna's story are the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana. Worship of a deity of Krishna, either in the form of Vasudeva, Bala Krishna or Gopala, can be traced to as early as 4th century BC. Worship of Krishna as svayam bhagavan, or the Supreme Being, known as Krishnaism, arose in the Middle Ages in the context of the bhakti movement. From the 10th century AD, Krishna became a favourite subject in performing arts and regional traditions of devotion developed for forms of Krishna such as Jagannatha in Orissa, Vithoba in Maharashtra and Shrinathji in Rajasthan. Since the 1960s the worship of Krishna has also spread in the West, largely due to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

The Hangman	2010	Hindi	" Like Us On Facebook- http://www.facebook.com/unisysmovies Om Puri is a fine actor. And so is Shreyas Talpade. But fine actors need a script, a narrative and a momentum to keep the interest high. The story isn't the problem with The Hangman. It's an interesting tale of a father's ambition to see his son move up in life and not end up like him, pulling the rope over convicts and killers. Sadly, it's a story that loses focus and winds up in incongruous venues, like rave parties and brothels. Enough to get you all fidgety and fussy. But there is something to watch out for in The Hangman: Om Puri as Shiva, the hangman. He paints a moving picture of a man desperate for change; of a father who wants a better life for his son, like all father's do. And yet, when the son inadvertently commits a crime, his principles remain intact. It's a compelling portrait of an ethical man who isn't willing to compromise on duty and morality, despite his love for his son. Shreyas, on the other hand, looks dated and outmoded in his weird shirts and his somewhat lost stance. The film has taken some time to find a release, having already done the festival rounds, almost a year ago.

Yaare Neenu Cheluve	1998	Kannada	" It's a multistar movie.It is a straight remake of the Tamil hit ""Kaadal Kottai"". Director Rajendra Babu can be credited as the captain for a film which is technically and musically superior. The film is entertaining and interesting in its own right. ""Yaare Neenu Cheluve"" almost reminds one of an old-world romance. Here the main hero Surya (Ravichandran) and Kamli (Sangeeta) fall in love and romance each other through letters without having seen or met each other even once. And the first time they meet and get to know each other is the climax of the film. This is the absorbing aspect of the film which keeps it going till then. Ramesh in an even more brief appearance as an aspiring suitor to the heroine, distinguishes himself for what he is a natural actor who can breathe life into every movement and emotion of his. Prakash Rai as the heroine's brother-in-law, makes a forceful impact. His larger-than-life screen presence and impressive dialogue delivery coupled with the nuances of expression make for some riveting and touching scenes in the film. It is worth making that trip to the theatre to see Rai if only for a while.One elementary aspect, which is the essence of the film, is the tender romance between the lovers.Hamsalekha's music enhances the mood of the film. The songs are celebratory: they are tuneful and more than pleasing, perhaps heralding Hamsalekha once again as a talent after a lean patch. D. V. Rajaram's cinematography lends a superior dimension to the film. ""Yaare Neenu Cheluve"" is a sleek production.
